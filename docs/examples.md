# Examples

Reading open source projects is a great way to learn how to write better code. However, it can be difficult to understand the codebase of a large project. In this book, I will provide examples of code snippets from well-known open-source projects such as Zod, tRPC, Hono, Elysia, and ts-odata-client. I will explain the code and show you how to apply the same patterns to your own projects.

Most Type-safe in the Modern TypeScript libraries use Template Literal Types, you can checkout [TypeScript Awesome Template Literal Types](https://github.com/ghoullier/awesome-template-literal-types) which is a curated list of awesome things related to TypeScript Template Literal Types.
