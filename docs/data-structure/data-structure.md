# Data Structure

Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. There are many different types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types.

In TypeScript, data structures are used to represent data in a structured way. They can be used to store data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate. TypeScript provides several built-in data structures, such as arrays, tuples, and objects, as well as the ability to define custom data structures using interfaces and classes.

In order to create type-safe data structures in TypeScript, it is important to understand the different types of data structures available, how they work, and when to use them. This guide will provide an overview of some of the most common data structures in TypeScript, and how to use them effectively in your code.

Not all data structures are type-safe, but some of them are very useful in TypeScript. Here are some data structures that are commonly used in TypeScript:
- Use [literal type](./literal-types) rathen than string
- Use [Record object](./record-object.md) rather than list/array
- Use [Tuple](./tuple.md) rather than list/array
